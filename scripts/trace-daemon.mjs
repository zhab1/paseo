// static module-graph tracing (@vercel/nft) from the daemon entry points.

// with only the bytes the daemon actually loads — no Expo, RN, Metro,
// Electron, ML stacks, or other non-daemon workspace bloat.

// Output: newline-separated repo-relative file paths on stdout. The Nix
// installPhase copies each path to $out/lib/paseo/<path>, preserving the

// Run from the repo root, after `npm run build:server`. Requires
// node_modules populated (the Nix build invokes this post-configHook).
