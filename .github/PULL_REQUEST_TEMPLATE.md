### Reasoning

<!-- A short description of the reasoning of this change in your own words. What was wrong, and how do you hope this PR fixes it. If you can't explain this briefly, the PR is probably too big. This description must be grounded in real user flows and framed as value provided to Paseo users. -->

### Goals

<!-- A bullet list of what this PR wants to accomplish, include requirements and acceptance criteria. This helps lock down the scope of the PR and prevent expanding scope over the intended goal. -->

### Non-goals

<!-- A bullet list of what this PR does not want to accomplish. Add any intentional trade offs taken. This helps lock down the scope of the PR and prevent expanding scope over the intended goal. -->

### QA

<!--
This is the section I read most carefully. I need to see that *you* tested this, not that the diff looks plausible.

- For UI changes: a screenshot or short video on every affected platform (mobile, web, desktop). UI claims without visual proof are not enough.
- For behavior changes: the actual steps you ran, and what you observed.
- For bug fixes: how you reproduced the bug before, and confirmed it's fixed after.
