# Data Model

## Project identity

Projects are allocated for the exact root selected by the caller, normalized lexically with `path.resolve` (never `realpath`). New project IDs are opaque `prj_<16 hex>` values. Existing remote-shaped or path-shaped IDs are retained as readable compatibility records and are never rekeyed. An active exact root is idempotent; archived-only matches do not resurrect an old project. Workspace `projectId` is stable membership: reconciliation may update git-derived kind and branch metadata, but never rehomes a workspace or changes a project's root, ID, or default name.

`projectKey` is a persisted, opaque equivalence key used only to group the same logical project
across hosts. It is separate from the host-local `projectId`; today's producer prefers a normalized
Git remote and otherwise uses the local project root. Consumers never derive it from live Git.
Creation persists it with the project, and normal boot reconciliation fills it for
older records where the field is absent—there is no migration.

`kind` and `projectKey` are mutable metadata, not identity. Workspace reconciliation watches active project roots and
updates those fields and `updatedAt` when Git facts change, preserving the project's ID, root path,
names, and workspace foreign keys. Attached workspaces are independently refreshed
from their own cwd, so an explicit project root never implies a workspace checkout. Empty projects
are observed too.

The workspace registry model defines placement once: initial directory/worktree construction,
mutable reconciliation fields, and the persisted-to-wire checkout projection. Its update policy
preserves `displayName` and `baseBranch`. `WorkspaceProvisioningService` owns the corresponding
registry writes, so directory opens, agent imports, and worktree creation all enter through that
service instead of constructing records independently. The workspace record is then the durable
placement authority: `cwd` is the exact execution directory, while `worktreeRoot` is the backing
checkout root. They intentionally differ for an exact subproject inside a worktree. Archive,
restore, branch auto-name, and descriptor flows consume those persisted facts rather than
rediscovering ownership from a directory that may already be gone. Reconciliation may refresh
mutable placement facts, but never changes `projectId`, `cwd`, `displayName`, or `baseBranch`.
Workspace archive runs lifecycle teardown from the exact `cwd` but removes only the backing
`worktreeRoot` after its last active reference disappears. Worktree recovery recreates that backing
checkout from `mainRepoRoot`, then restores the relative path from `worktreeRoot` to `cwd`.

Paseo uses **file-based JSON persistence** instead of a traditional database. All data is validated at runtime with Zod schemas. Most stores write atomically (write to temp file, then rename); a few still use plain `writeFile` — see each section. There is no schema-versioning/migration framework — schemas rely on optional fields with defaults for forward compatibility, with a small amount of inline normalization in `persisted-config.ts` for legacy provider/speech entries.

All server-side stores live under `$PASEO_HOME` (defaults to `~/.paseo`).

## Store Surface Rules

Store APIs own persistence atomicity and should not make services coordinate raw reads and writes. A good store method maps cleanly to one SQL statement or one SQL transaction, even when the current implementation is JSON files. If a caller needs a queue, lock, read-merge-write loop, or uniqueness race workaround, that behavior belongs behind the store surface.

The `agents/{sanitized-cwd}/` directory name is derived from the agent's `cwd` by stripping the filesystem root and replacing path separators with `-` (Windows drive letters become a `C-` style prefix). Persistent server stores write atomically by writing a temp file in the target directory and then renaming it into place.

## 1. Agent Record

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/agents/{project-dir}/{agentId}.json`

Each agent is stored as a separate JSON file, grouped by project directory.

## Runtime-only Terminal Sessions

Terminals are live daemon state, not persisted JSON records. A terminal carries a `workspaceId` while it is running; workspace-scoped terminal lists include only terminals with the matching `workspaceId`. Legacy live terminals without an owner remain visible to unscoped terminal reads but contribute to no workspace status.

Terminal activity contributes to the workspace status bucket **per `workspaceId`**: a working terminal drives `running` onto the workspace it carries only. Same-`cwd` siblings are untouched; terminal visibility is likewise `workspaceId`-scoped.

---

## 2. Daemon Configuration

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/config.json`

Single file, validated with `PersistedConfigSchema`.

`agents.skills.selection` is the daemon host's orchestration-skill preference. Missing means
`{ mode: "all" }`. Installed state is not persisted; the daemon derives it from its three managed
skill directories and keeps config plus filesystem convergence behind one serialized owner.

`paseo reload` reads and validates this file once inside the daemon. That snapshot drives resolution,
classification, application, and reload bookkeeping. `DaemonConfigStore` owns applying runtime-safe
fields and their removal/default semantics; session handlers and the CLI only relay the structured
result. Normal config patches persist only the requested fields, so launch overrides and resolved
defaults never leak into the file. Startup-only fields remain compared with the daemon's launch
snapshot so a mixed edit can apply its live subset and still name the paths that require restart.

```
{
  version: 1,
  daemon: {
    listen: "127.0.0.1:6767",
    hostnames: true | string[],   // legacy alias `allowedHosts` is migrated on load

    mcp: { enabled: boolean, injectIntoAgents: boolean },
    git: { maxProcessesPerSecond: number, maxProcessConcurrency: number },
    appendSystemPrompt: string,    // appended to supported provider system/developer prompts
    terminalProfiles: TerminalProfile[],  // named shell commands; omitted means DEFAULT_TERMINAL_PROFILES
    agentProfiles: AgentProfile[],        // named agent launch bundles; omitted means none
    cors: { allowedOrigins: string[] },
    relay: { enabled: boolean, endpoint: string, publicEndpoint: string, useTls: boolean, publicUseTls: boolean }, // new homes materialize enabled: false
    auth: { password: string }    // bcrypt hash, optional
  },
  app: {
    baseUrl: string
  },
  worktrees?: {
    root?: string            // optional root for new worktrees; defaults to $PASEO_HOME/worktrees
    servicePorts?: {         // optional dynamic service port allocation policy
      range?: string         // inclusive range, e.g. "3000-4000"
      portScript?: string    // executable that receives service/workspace context and prints one TCP port
    }
  },
  providers: {
    openai: {
      apiKey?: string,
      baseUrl?: string,
      stt?: { apiKey?: string, baseUrl?: string },
      tts?: { apiKey?: string, baseUrl?: string }
    },
    local: { modelsDir: string }
  },
  agents: {
    skills?: {
      selection?: { mode: "all" } | { mode: "custom", skills: string[] }
    },
    // ProviderOverrideSchema; legacy entries with `command: { mode, ... }` are migrated to the
    // current shape on load via `migrateProviderSettings`. Custom provider IDs must declare
    // `extends` (one of the built-ins or `"acp"`) and `label`. See `provider-launch-config.ts`.
    providers: Record<providerId, ProviderOverride>,
    metadataGeneration: {
      providers: [{ provider, model?, thinkingOptionId? }]
    }
  },
  pluginsEnabled: boolean,
  plugins: Record<pluginId, { source: "directory", path: string, enabled?: boolean }>,
  features: {
    dictation: { enabled, stt: { provider, model, language, confidenceThreshold } },
    voiceMode: { enabled, llm, stt: { provider, model, language }, turnDetection, tts: { provider, model, voice, speakerId, speed } }
  },
  log: {
    level, format,
    console: { level, format },
    file: { level, path, rotate: { maxSize, maxFiles } }
  }
}
```

All fields are optional with sensible defaults.

Git-managed plugins still appear as directory sources in `config.json`. This keeps the plugin
runtime and protocol config compatible with directory-only clients. `plugins/sources.json` owns the
Git-specific origin, tracking ref, installed commit, repository subdirectory, and checkout root.
Paseo writes it atomically. An update creates and validates a new version directory before changing
the configured directory path; successful activation removes the old version.

### Profile lists

`terminalProfiles` and `agentProfiles` are both whole-list fields: a config patch replaces the
array, never merges entries, so a client sends the complete next list on every add, edit, reorder
and remove. List order is the display order.

Absent and empty mean different things for terminal profiles — omitting the key falls back to
`DEFAULT_TERMINAL_PROFILES`, while `[]` means the user removed them all. Agent profiles have no
defaults, so both mean none.

`PersistedConfigSchema` parses strictly, so a daemon that predates a field drops it on write
rather than storing something it cannot describe. That is why the client gates the agent profiles
UI on `server_info.features.agentProfiles` instead of letting a save appear to succeed against an
older daemon.

### Agent provider Paseo tools

`agents.providers` is keyed by the exact provider ID used to launch the agent. The built-in IDs are
`claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `opencode`, `pi`, and `omp`. Custom provider IDs are their literal
configuration keys, such as `my-claude` or `zai`, not the provider named by `extends`.

Each entry may include a Paseo-tool policy:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "providers": {
      "my-claude": {
        "extends": "claude",
        "label": "My Claude",
        "paseoTools": {
          "enabled": true,
          "disabledTools": ["browser_evaluate"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Absent `paseoTools`, or absent fields within it, means Paseo tools are enabled and all tools are
allowed. `enabled: false` disables the provider's Paseo catalog; `disabledTools` lists exact tool
IDs to omit. The policy covers the core and browser catalog, not the voice-only `speak` tool.
Browser tools also require `daemon.browserTools.enabled` and a connected browser host.
This policy controls the catalog presented to an agent. It is not an authorization boundary for
agents that can access the host through a shell.

`daemon.mcp.injectIntoAgents` is the global override. When it is `false`, no provider receives
Paseo tools; otherwise the provider policy applies. Provider and global policy are resolved when a
session is created, resumed, imported, or reloaded, so configuration changes affect the next
session rather than an already-running one.

`agents.metadataGeneration.providers` controls the preferred structured-generation fallback order for daemon-side metadata tasks such as commit messages, PR text, branch names, and generated agent titles. Entries are tried first in the configured order, then Paseo falls through to dynamically discovered defaults and finally the current selection when available.

### Git process limits

Git process limits are global to one daemon. The start-rate limit defaults to `64` processes per
second, and the concurrency limit defaults to `8`:

```json
{
  "daemon": {
    "git": {
      "maxProcessesPerSecond": 64,
      "maxProcessConcurrency": 8
    }
  }
}
```

`maxProcessesPerSecond` limits Git process starts in any one-second interval. The allowance can
start as a burst; it does not wait for earlier processes to exit. `maxProcessConcurrency` limits
the number of Git processes that have started but not exited. Every Git command uses both limits,
including initial workspace reads, filesystem-triggered refreshes, background checks, and explicit
requests.

Environment variables override `config.json`:

| Environment variable                 | Setting                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `PASEO_GIT_MAX_PROCESSES_PER_SECOND` | `maxProcessesPerSecond`  |
| `PASEO_GIT_MAX_PROCESS_CONCURRENCY`  | `maxProcessConcurrency`  |
| `PASEO_GIT_CONCURRENCY`              | Legacy concurrency alias |

`PASEO_GIT_MAX_PROCESS_CONCURRENCY` wins when it and the legacy alias are both set. Run `paseo reload`
after changing `config.json`. Environment changes require a daemon restart; the launch environment
remains authoritative during reload.

`agents.metadataGeneration.providers` controls the preferred structured-generation fallback order for daemon-side metadata tasks such as commit messages, PR text, branch names, and generated agent titles. Entries are tried first in the configured order, then Paseo falls through to dynamically discovered defaults and finally the current selection when available.

Local speech model ids are intentionally narrow: STT uses `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`, TTS uses `kokoro-en-v0_19`, and turn detection uses the bundled Silero VAD model.

Set these to select OpenAI instead of local speech:

| Env var                        | Applies to                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `PASEO_VOICE_STT_PROVIDER`     | Voice mode STT provider         |
| `PASEO_DICTATION_STT_PROVIDER` | Composer dictation STT provider |
| `PASEO_VOICE_TTS_PROVIDER`     | Voice mode TTS provider         |

OpenAI speech can be configured under `providers.openai`. STT and TTS resolve independently, so they can point at different endpoints:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "stt": {
        "apiKey": "sk-...",
        "baseUrl": "https://stt.example.com/v1"
      },
      "tts": {
        "apiKey": "sk-...",
        "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`providers.openai.stt` is used for both composer dictation and voice mode speech-to-text; `providers.openai.tts` is used for voice mode text-to-speech. The equivalent env vars are `OPENAI_STT_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_STT_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_TTS_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_TTS_BASE_URL`. Each feature falls back to `providers.openai.apiKey`/`providers.openai.baseUrl`, then `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, when its own fields are unset. These settings apply only to Paseo OpenAI speech features, not to Codex or other OpenAI-backed tools.

Paseo uses these paths under the configured OpenAI base URL:

- dictation STT: `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- voice mode STT: `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- voice mode TTS: `/v1/audio/speech`

Uploading a file and pasting a website or image URL are two ways of _acquiring_ the same custom
icon. The client fetches URL imports and sends their bytes through the upload RPC. The daemon never
receives or fetches the URL; it validates the uploaded bytes, stores them, and records a new
`customIconRevision`. Going back to automatic deletes the stored image, as does removing the
project.

Active exact roots are idempotent using lexical platform-equivalence semantics. Existing legacy
remote-shaped and path-shaped IDs remain readable, including duplicate roots; reconciliation never
merges them, transfers names, archives them, or moves workspace foreign keys. An explicit
workspace `projectId` is authoritative when it names an active project, regardless of cwd
containment. Archived-only exact-root records are not resurrected by explicit add/open; a fresh
opaque project is allocated instead. Agent restore is separate and restores the agent's existing
workspace together with its owning project.

> **Opaque-ID invariant:** `workspaceId` is opaque identity, never a filesystem path. Filesystem and git operations take `cwd`/`workspaceDirectory` only — never the id. A compatibility-only first-materialization bootstrap still groups pre-registry agent records by path and Git remote so existing installs retain their legacy records. That grouping never runs against a live registry, and its keys are not runtime project or workspace identity.

### Workspace label catalog

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/projects/workspace-labels.json`

The catalog is shared by every workspace on one host. A definition contains a display name and one
of the ten identity colour names (`WORKSPACE_LABEL_COLORS` in
`packages/protocol/src/workspace-labels.ts`); trimmed, collapsed, case-insensitive name identity is
unique within that file. Definitions have no portable ID or principal owner and remain after their
last assignment. Editing a label takes a new name, a new colour, or both in one commit, so the two
fields cannot land half-applied. Workspaces store label names, so a rename and a delete rewrite
workspace assignments through one serialized compound commit while a recolour is catalog-only; a
rename onto a name the host already has is refused rather than merged. A prepared
`workspace-labels.transaction.json` contains both before and after images. The daemon writes the
catalog and workspace files, then atomically changes the transaction to committed; that phase
change is the durable commit point. Recovery rolls prepared transactions back before either
directory is served. A committed marker proves both data files were already written, so recovery
only loads the current catalog and retries marker cleanup; it never reapplies stale workspace
after-images over later registry mutations. A request rejected before the commit point therefore
cannot take effect after restart. If the live daemon cannot determine or restore the durable state,
the workspace registry freezes every write and later label mutations fail with
`workspace_label_storage_uncertain` until daemon restart performs recovery. Reads remain available,
but may reflect the last acknowledged cache until restart. Workspace directory and catalog updates
publish only after the commit point; publication failure does not roll durable state back.

`projectId` is still a real FK: workspace records should have a matching project record. Read-only
history surfaces tolerate transient orphaned workspaces by omitting those rows so one bad FK cannot
blank the whole History screen, but mutation paths should repair or remove the orphaned state rather
than treating it as valid.

## 6. Push Token Store

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/push-tokens.json`

```json
{
  "tokens": ["ExponentPushToken[...]", ...]
}
```

Simple set of Expo push notification tokens. Loaded with permissive parsing (filters non-string entries). Persisted with atomic temp-file rename.

## 7. Daemon meta files

These small files are not validated as full Zod schemas but are persisted under `$PASEO_HOME` for daemon identity and runtime coordination.

## Client-side stores (App)

These live in React Native `AsyncStorage` or browser `IndexedDB`, not on the daemon filesystem.

### Keying convention: directory-backed vs workspace-owned

Right-sidebar client state splits on whether it is determined by the directory or owned by the workspace (two workspaces can share one `cwd`). The split is enforced by the cache key, so changing a key changes the sharing semantics — see [architecture.md](architecture.md#right-sidebar-boundary-directory-backed-vs-workspace-owned) for the full table.

- **Directory-backed** (shared by same-`cwd` workspaces): keyed by `(serverId, cwd)`. Git status/diff, GitHub PR status, PR timeline, file preview content. These are TanStack Query caches, not persisted stores.
- **Workspace-owned** (independent per workspace): keyed by `workspaceId`, with `cwd` used only as a fallback when no `workspaceId` is present. Review draft comments (`@paseo:review-draft-store`), diff-mode overrides (in-memory), workspace composer attachments, and file-explorer nav/expand state. The `workspaceId` part of these keys is **opaque** — never parse it back into a path.

### Replica row store

The durable client replica uses IndexedDB on browser/Electron and expo-sqlite on native. Rows use the
compound key `(serverId, kind, id)`; kinds are `agent`, `workspace`, `project`, `timeline`, and
`checkpoint`. Directory entities have individual rows, timelines use the agent id, and the checkpoint
uses the singleton id.

The store is a typed persistence boundary. It returns values to directory and timeline owners and
accepts their explicit commits; it never reads or writes UI state. Reads are scoped to the requested
host, kinds, and ids. Opening a cached workspace uses exact workspace and project keys rather than a
directory scan. One invalid row is deleted and returned as a miss without affecting other rows.
An invalid directory row and its affected checkpoint cursor are repaired in one transaction, so a
later launch cannot accept a checkpoint for a partial baseline. Directory changes and their
checkpoint are also applied in one transaction.

The cache is capped at 32 MiB and evicts whole hosts in least-recently-written order. Budget
bookkeeping may scan opaque row sizes during a deferred write, never during host registry startup or
before a requested cache row can paint. The row store is not encrypted. A cached timeline can contain
source code, prompts, and tool output; encrypted-at-rest storage is a separate security decision.

### Draft Store

**AsyncStorage key:** `paseo-drafts` (version 2)

```typescript
{
  drafts: Record<draftKey, {
    input: { text: string, images: AttachmentMetadata[] },
    lifecycle: "active" | "abandoned" | "sent",
    updatedAt: number,     // epoch ms
    version: number        // optimistic concurrency
  }>,
  createModalDraft: DraftRecord | null
}
```

### Attachment Store (Web)

**IndexedDB database:** `paseo-attachment-bytes`, object store: `attachments`

Stores binary attachment blobs keyed by attachment ID.

### AttachmentMetadata

| Field         | Type      | Description                    |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `id`          | `string`  | Unique attachment ID           |
| `mimeType`    | `string`  | MIME type                      |
| `storageType` | `string`  | Storage backend identifier     |
| `storageKey`  | `string`  | Key within the storage backend |
| `createdAt`   | `number`  | Epoch ms                       |
| `fileName`    | `string?` | Original filename              |
| `byteSize`    | `number?` | Size in bytes                  |
