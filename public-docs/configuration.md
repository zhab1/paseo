# Configuration

Paseo loads configuration from a single JSON file in your Paseo home directory, with optional environment variable and CLI overrides.

## Where config lives

By default, Paseo uses `~/.paseo` as its home directory. The configuration file is:

```bash
~/.paseo/config.json
```

You can change the home directory by setting `PASEO_HOME` or passing `--home` to `paseo daemon start`.

## Precedence

Paseo merges configuration in this order:

1. Defaults
2. `config.json`
3. Environment variables
4. CLI flags

Lists append across sources (for example, `hostnames` and `cors.allowedOrigins`).

## Example

Minimal example that configures listening address, hostnames, and MCP:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://paseo.sh/schemas/paseo.config.v1.json",
  "version": 1,
  "daemon": {
    "listen": "127.0.0.1:6767",
    "hostnames": ["localhost", ".localhost"],
    "mcp": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

`daemon.hostnames` is the primary field. The old `daemon.allowedHosts` name still works as a deprecated alias for backward compatibility.

## Apply changes

After saving `config.json`, reload it:

```bash
paseo reload
```

The daemon validates the complete file before applying anything. It applies runtime-safe changes and lists any settings that still need a restart. If it reports restart-required paths, run:

```bash
paseo daemon restart
```

Runtime-safe settings include relay enablement, MCP settings, browser tools, hostnames, CORS origins, trusted proxies, Git process limits, agent and terminal profiles, provider definitions, metadata generation, the app base URL, provider catalog timeout, and the global plugin switch. Removing one of these settings applies its omitted-field behavior; removing a provider removes it from future launches.

New homes keep relay disabled when you remove `daemon.relay.enabled`. A daemon whose config already omitted this field when it started keeps the legacy relay-enabled behavior for compatibility. Set `daemon.relay.enabled` explicitly when editing an older config.

Listen addresses, authentication, relay endpoints and TLS, worktree allocation, service-proxy addresses, the bundled web UI, logging, speech, voice, credentials, and local model settings require a restart. Reload applies other valid edits in the same file before reporting those paths.

Environment variables and daemon start flags remain authoritative. Reload reports a changed file setting under `overrideControlledPaths` when a launch override prevents it from taking effect. This includes startup settings such as listen addresses, passwords, relay endpoints and TLS, service-proxy and web UI settings, logging, speech, and voice configuration. List settings such as hostnames and CORS origins still append across sources, so values from `config.json` continue to apply. Remove the override and restart the daemon if you want the file value to become authoritative.

## Agent providers

Agent providers, both the first-class ones Paseo ships with and custom entries you add under `agents.providers`, are documented on their own page.

See [Providers](/docs/providers) for the mental model and [Supported providers](/docs/supported-providers) for the full list of agents Paseo can launch. For pointing Claude at Anthropic-compatible endpoints (Z.AI, Alibaba/Qwen), multiple profiles, custom binaries, ACP agents, and the `additionalModels` merge behavior, see [Custom providers](/docs/custom-providers). The full field reference lives on GitHub at [docs/custom-providers.md](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/blob/main/docs/custom-providers.md).

## Worktrees

New worktrees are created under `$PASEO_HOME/worktrees` by default. To place new worktrees somewhere else, set `worktrees.root`:

```json
{
  "worktrees": {
    "root": "/mnt/fast/paseo-worktrees"
  }
}
```

Relative paths are resolved against `PASEO_HOME`. Existing worktrees remain where they are; changing this setting only changes where Paseo creates and discovers Paseo-managed worktrees going forward.

## Voice

Voice is configured through `features.dictation` and `features.voiceMode`, with provider credentials under `providers`.

For voice philosophy, architecture, and complete local/OpenAI setup examples, see [Voice docs](/docs/voice).

## Bundled web UI

The daemon can serve the browser web client from the same HTTP server. This is enabled in the official Docker image and disabled by default for normal CLI and desktop-managed daemons.

Enable it from the CLI:

```bash
paseo daemon start --web-ui
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
PASEO_WEB_UI_ENABLED=true paseo daemon start
```

Or persist it in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "webUi": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

When enabled, open the daemon HTTP origin, for example `http://localhost:6767/`, to load the web app. Static UI files load without daemon auth; API and WebSocket requests still require the configured password.

## Logging

Daemon logging uses separate console and file sinks by default:

- Console: `info` and above
- File (`$PASEO_HOME/daemon.log`): `trace` and above
- File rotation: `10m` max file size, `2` retained files total (active + 1 rotated)

```json
{
  "log": {
    "console": {
      "level": "info",
      "format": "pretty"
    },
    "file": {
      "level": "trace",
      "path": "daemon.log",
      "rotate": {
        "maxSize": "10m",
        "maxFiles": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Legacy fields `log.level` and `log.format` are still supported and map to the new destination settings.

## Password authentication

You can require a password to connect to the daemon. When set, all HTTP and WebSocket clients must authenticate. Only the `/api/health` liveness endpoint is exempt, so that process supervisors and load balancers can probe without credentials.

The easiest way to set a password is with the CLI:

```bash
paseo daemon set-password
```

This prompts for a password, writes the bcrypt hash to `config.json`, and tells you to restart the daemon. Authentication is a startup setting, so `paseo reload` will also report it as restart-required.

Alternatively, set the `PASEO_PASSWORD` environment variable (plaintext, hashed automatically at startup):

```bash
PASEO_PASSWORD=my-secret paseo daemon start
```

Or write the hash directly in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "daemon": {
    "auth": {
      "password": "$2b$12$..."
    }
  }
}
```

After setting a password, restart the daemon for the change to take effect.

### Connecting with a password

The CLI picks up a password from, in order:

1. The `password` query parameter on a `tcp://` host URI:

   ```bash
   paseo --host "tcp://192.168.1.10:6767?password=my-secret" ls
   ```

2. The `PASEO_PASSWORD` environment variable, used as a fallback when the host carries no embedded password (works for `localhost:6767`, bare `host:port`, or `tcp://` hosts without a `password=` query):

   ```bash
   PASEO_PASSWORD=my-secret paseo ls
   PASEO_PASSWORD=my-secret paseo --host 192.168.1.10:6767 ls
   ```

A `password=` in the URI always wins over the env var, so you can keep `PASEO_PASSWORD` set globally and still target a different daemon by spelling its password into the URI.

In the mobile app, enter the password in the direct connection setup screen.

## Relay

New homes write `daemon.relay.enabled: false`. Paseo asks before enabling relay when you pair a device; existing homes keep their saved value. See [Connectivity](/docs/connectivity) to choose and configure a connection method, and [Security](/docs/security) for the relay encryption model.

Set the persisted value in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "daemon": {
    "relay": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

`PASEO_RELAY_ENABLED=true|false` overrides the persisted value for that daemon launch. The matching `paseo daemon start --relay` and `--no-relay` flags have the same authority. Remove the launch override before changing relay from Paseo Desktop or `paseo daemon pair --relay`.

## Common env vars
