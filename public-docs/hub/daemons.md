# Daemons in Hub

A daemon is one of your machines running the Paseo daemon. Enroll it once with your Hub organization, then triggers can reference it.

## Connect

Log in from the machine first:

```sh
paseo hub login https://hub.example.com
```

The CLI prints a URL and a verification code and opens your browser. The approved login is stored under `PASEO_HOME`.

In an interactive terminal, login offers to connect this daemon and separately asks whether to allow Hub automations to run agents. Connection defaults to yes; execution permission defaults to no. It then links to **Triggers** and prints `paseo hub init` for creating a starter trigger as code. `--json` or non-TTY login only logs in. [Quickstart](/docs/hub/quickstart) walks through connection and initialization.

Enroll the daemon on its own when you declined, or when the machine is already logged in:

```sh
paseo hub connect
```

`connect` uses the active login to request a single-use enrollment token. The daemon exchanges it for its own relationship credential; your CLI login is never stored as daemon authority.

Hub derives the daemon's initial slug from its hostname. If that slug is already used in the organization, Hub adds a short daemon ID suffix. You can rename the daemon later in Hub.

Each daemon has two identifiers: an immutable generated ID and a friendly slug. Hub normalizes slugs with lowercase words joined by hyphens, so `Build Studio` becomes `build-studio`. The slug is what the dashboard shows and what configuration references.

You can rename the slug later without changing the daemon ID. Renaming after a configuration is active means updating that configuration.

For unattended setup, pass an organization API key without storing it:

```sh
PASEO_HUB_URL=https://hub.example.com PASEO_HUB_API_KEY=paseo_pk_... paseo hub connect
```

Origin precedence is explicit `[origin]`, `PASEO_HUB_URL`, active stored login, then `https://hub.paseo.sh`. An explicit `--api-key <secret>` takes precedence over the environment and an exact-origin stored login.

Check and undo:

```sh
paseo hub status
paseo hub disconnect
paseo hub disconnect --force   # drop local authority when Hub is unreachable
```

One daemon has one Hub relationship. Connecting a daemon that already has one is refused.

`paseo hub logout` removes the active CLI login. The daemon's relationship is a separate identity and stays connected.

In an interactive terminal, logout offers to disconnect a daemon enrolled with the same Hub. Accepting disconnects first and then deletes the login, so a failed disconnection keeps your credential. Declining removes only the login.

Noninteractive and `--json` logout never disconnect implicitly:

```sh
paseo hub logout --disconnect-daemon           # remove both identities
paseo hub logout --disconnect-daemon --force   # drop local authority when Hub is unreachable
```

## Reference it from configuration

```yaml
environments:
  dev:
    kind: daemon
    daemon: my-macbook
    cwd: /Users/you/code/your-repo
```

`daemon` is the friendly slug. It resolves to the immutable daemon ID when the configuration activates, so a daemon that no longer exists fails activation instead of failing at dispatch.

`cwd` is a path on that machine. Hub does not clone anything for you; the directory must already exist.

To keep executions off your working tree, add a worktree:

```yaml
worktree:
  mode: branch-off
  newBranch: trigger-${{ paseo.execution.id }}
  base: origin/main
```

`${{ paseo.execution.id }}` renders the execution's UUID, so every execution gets its own branch off `origin/main`.

[Environment fields](/docs/hub/configuration/hub-yml#environments) lists what `newBranch` accepts. See [Git worktrees](/docs/worktrees) for setup hooks and scripts.

## What Hub owns

For agents it dispatched, Hub owns creation, reconnect recovery, output observation, and completion. Agents you start yourself are untouched.

If Hub loses the create response, or the daemon restarts mid-execution, Hub resends the same create intent with the same execution id. The daemon returns the existing agent rather than running the prompt again. An agent that closed or errored is recorded as interrupted; Hub never silently starts a second one.

## Status

| Status            | Meaning                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Approval required | The CLI is waiting for you to approve the code |
| Connected         | Online and accepting dispatch                  |
| Offline           | Enrolled but not currently connected           |
| Revoked           | Access removed from Hub                        |

An event that arrives while a daemon is offline fails dispatch with `daemon_not_connected`. Nothing is queued for later. The event is in the project's Activity, and the trigger has to fire again.

Revoking from **Daemons → Revoke daemon** ends the relationship from Hub's side. The daemon keeps running your local agents.
