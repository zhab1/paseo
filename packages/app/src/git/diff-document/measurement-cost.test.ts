/**
 * A text backend that can only measure a whole string costs O(string length)
 * per call, so measuring cumulative advances by re-shaping a growing prefix
 * shapes n^2/2 characters for one line of n characters. That froze the renderer
 * for ~10s on a 42-line CHANGELOG.md diff and for over 15 minutes on a diff
 * containing a single 1.2M-character line.
 *
 * Cost is counted in *shaped characters* rather than calls, because that is the
 * quantity that maps to renderer CPU time. The budgets below are the linear
 * contract of the shared advance measurement in `text-measurement.ts`: work
 * stays proportional to the text, with a constant bounded by the shaped-run cap.
