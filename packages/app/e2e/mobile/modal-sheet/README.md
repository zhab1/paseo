# Native modal and sheet gestures

## Compact sheet gestures

Use an Android emulator at 1080×1920, density 420, with the checkout's native app bundle loaded.
Connect the app to an isolated daemon, enable plugins, and install `plugin-examples/modal-ui` there.
Set `SHEET_QA_SERVER_ID` to that host's server ID, then run from the repository root:

```sh
agent-device test packages/app/e2e/mobile/modal-sheet/gestures.android.ad \
  --env EXAMPLES_URL="paseo://h/${SHEET_QA_SERVER_ID}/plugin/modal-ui-example/surface/main" \
  --record-video --artifacts-dir .dev/sheet-qa/plugin

agent-device test packages/app/e2e/mobile/modal-sheet/model.android.ad \
  --env FORM_URL="paseo://new?serverId=${SHEET_QA_SERVER_ID}" \
  --record-video --artifacts-dir .dev/sheet-qa/model
```

The plugin journey checks body dismissal, reopening, expansion and last-row reachability with SDK
ScrollView and FlatList, programmatic scrolling after expansion, downward list scrolling, and
horizontal tab selection. The model journey checks body dismissal and the nested sheet's return to
its parent without selecting a model or submitting a prompt. It does not assert catalog contents.

These scripts live outside the default mobile suite because they require the installed example and
an explicit connected host. See [mobile testing](../../../../../docs/mobile-testing.md) for device setup.

### Recorded verification

Android API 35, 1080×1920 at density 420, development binary 0.7.2 with this checkout's JavaScript.
Plugin tests used an isolated daemon. Recordings show the same body drag
[before](evidence/android-before.mp4) and [after](evidence/android-after.mp4) the fix.
The [browser recording](evidence/browser.webm) covers the existing plugin modal journey at wide and
compact sizes.

```text
Baseline dismissal regression:
failed at step 6: wait timed out for selector: label="Open ScrollView"
Current surface: Bottom sheet handle, Bottom Sheet, Close, Row 1.

Fixed dismissal regression: 1 passed (6.47s)
Full plugin gesture journey: 1 passed (44.3s)
Model sheet dismissal/reopen journey: 1 passed (13.7s)
Browser plugin-modal-body.spec.ts: 1 passed (33.4s)
Root typecheck, lint and format: passed
```

The model form's catalog stayed on “Loading…” in the debug app even though the isolated daemon's
provider API returned models. Its sheet dismissal/reopen was exercised; populated model selection
was not. iOS and Electron were not exercised.

## Tablet model selection

`model-tablet.android.ad` exercises the New workspace popover. `model-tablet-agent.android.ad`
exercises the modal used by an existing agent's narrow composer on a wide device. Both drill into
a populated provider, select a real model, assert the updated trigger, reopen, and dismiss with
Android Back. New workspace also pans beyond the short list viewport and flings back without
selecting a row or dismissing the popover. They do not submit a prompt.

Use an English-language Android tablet at 1600×2560, density 320 (800dp), with this checkout's
JavaScript and a connected isolated daemon. On a Pixel Tablet AVD, rotate to portrait explicitly;
its natural landscape orientation letterboxes this portrait-locked app into the compact layout:

```sh
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" shell settings put system accelerometer_rotation 0
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" shell settings put system user_rotation 1
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" shell wm density 320
```

Prepare an idle agent through the daemon's public `createAgent` API with a real provider/model and
no initial prompt. Set `MODEL_QA_AGENT_ID` and `MODEL_QA_AGENT_TITLE` to that agent. In New workspace,
remember a model first (the phone layout works on the broken baseline), then close the picker.
Choose a model visible on the provider's first page and set its catalog ID and displayed label.
Set `MODEL_QA_LAST_MODEL_ID` to its initially offscreen last model; use a short overflowing catalog
(six rows during this verification) for the coordinate-based pan/fling regression:

```sh
agent-device test packages/app/e2e/mobile/modal-sheet/model-tablet.android.ad \
  packages/app/e2e/mobile/modal-sheet/model-tablet-agent.android.ad \
  --serial "$ANDROID_SERIAL" --metro-port "$MODEL_QA_METRO_PORT" \
  --env FORM_URL="paseo://new?serverId=${SHEET_QA_SERVER_ID}" \
  --env AGENT_URL="paseo://h/${SHEET_QA_SERVER_ID}/agent/${MODEL_QA_AGENT_ID}" \
  --env AGENT_TITLE="$MODEL_QA_AGENT_TITLE" \
  --env PROVIDER_ID=codex --env MODEL_ID="$MODEL_QA_MODEL_ID" \
  --env MODEL_LABEL="$MODEL_QA_MODEL_LABEL" --env LAST_MODEL_ID="$MODEL_QA_LAST_MODEL_ID" \
  --artifacts-dir /tmp/paseo-model-tablet-qa
```

The existing-agent journey needs the sidebar pinned so its composer stays narrow. Start each run with no modal open;
a failed provider tap leaves its modal open, so dismiss it before the next run. These host-dependent
journeys remain outside the default mobile suite, alongside the compact sheet journeys above.

Keep generated screenshots, recordings, and run logs outside the repository.

## Stacked adaptive sheets

`stacked-pairing.ad` opens the welcome screen's pairing sheet and then the root-mounted host
confirmation. It first types without tapping the input to verify autofocus, then cancels the
confirmation, closes and reopens the underlying sheet, confirms again,
and completes the password retry. `stacked-settings.ad` checks the same return and retry through
Settings → add host → Direct connection → Advanced. Run both on phones and tablets so both the
bottom sheet and centered dialog are exercised.

These integration journeys require the host-confirmation flow in the test app. Include both the
sheet fix and that flow in the QA checkout when verifying them; the production sheet component
has no dependency on the host-confirmation feature.

Use a fresh English app with notification permission granted and first-use keyboard prompts
already dismissed. Load this checkout from an isolated Metro. Start an isolated password-protected
daemon and a local Wrangler relay with `--var 'PASEO_RELAY_UPSTREAM:'`; the checked-in upstream
setting otherwise forwards traffic to the hosted relay, which drops password rejection replies.
Set `PAIRING_LINK` to the daemon's `relay://` URI with an intentionally incorrect `password` query
parameter, and `PASSWORD` to its correct password. This exercises password retry even while the
daemon accepts relay connections with no credential.

```sh
agent-device replay packages/app/e2e/mobile/modal-sheet/stacked-pairing.ad \
  --state-dir "$SHEET_QA_DEVICE_STATE" --session stacked-ipad --platform ios \
  --udid "$SHEET_QA_IOS_UDID" \
  --env PAIRING_LINK="$SHEET_QA_LINK" --env PASSWORD="$SHEET_QA_PASSWORD" \
  --env OUT="$SHEET_QA_OUTPUT"
```

For Settings, first open Settings with Add host visible. With a saved host, open Switch host
first. Use a second loopback spelling
(`localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`) for the same local relay so the saved host asks for confirmation
of its changed connection. Pass that link to `stacked-settings.ad` with the same arguments.
For an app with no saved hosts, use the original link; Add host is visible directly in Settings.

Android uses the same journeys: copy each script outside the repository, change its context's
`platform=ios` to `platform=android`, and pass `--serial` instead of `--udid`. Reverse both Metro
(including the port advertised by its manifest) and the local relay ports. Keep driver state,
artifacts, and sessions separate from other runs. These host-dependent journeys remain outside the
default mobile suite, alongside the existing modal-sheet scripts.

On iPhone, bulk replacement or bulk keyboard entry of the advanced URI field triggers a
repeated-update error with both the parent and stacked-sheet implementations. Entering the complete
URI one character at a time passed with both implementations; faster typing remains unverified.
On iPad, replacing the field a second time appends text. For this Settings journey, use the
native clipboard Paste menu, then continue the assertions manually. Dismiss the password keyboard
with Done to submit when the Connect button is below the keyboard. The welcome pairing regression
runs end to end without these adjustments.
