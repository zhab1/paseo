# Paseo vs OpenChamber

OpenChamber is an MIT-licensed workspace built around OpenCode, with desktop, web, VS Code, server, and Capacitor mobile clients.

Paseo orchestrates many coding-agent harnesses from desktop, mobile, web, and the CLI. Open source under Apache-2.0.

## The main difference

OpenChamber builds its agent workflow around OpenCode. Paseo runs OpenCode alongside Claude Code, Codex, Pi, ACP agents, and custom providers.

OpenChamber packages its web interface for iOS and Android with Capacitor. The interface runs inside WKWebView or Android WebView, with native integrations for notifications, secure storage, QR pairing, and widgets. Paseo's mobile client is built with React Native and distributed through the App Store and Google Play.

## Architecture

Both tools can run a server on your workstation or another machine and connect from desktop, web, and mobile clients.

Paseo's daemon launches each provider through its own native harness or through ACP. OpenChamber manages an OpenCode server and builds its agent workflow around OpenCode sessions.

## Providers

OpenChamber uses OpenCode as its agent runtime. OpenCode can connect to many model providers, and OpenChamber also offers integrations for subscriptions such as Claude.

Paseo is multi-provider at the agent-harness layer. It runs Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Antigravity, and Muse Code natively, plus 30+ agents through its ACP catalog and any custom CLI agent. See [all supported providers](/agents).

## Application plugins

[Paseo plugins](/docs/plugins) extend Paseo itself. They can add server behavior and native client components such as workspace panels, sidebar items, composer attachments, themes, and Command Center items across desktop, browser, iOS, and Android.

OpenChamber does not document an application extension API for adding both server behavior and native client components.

## Workspaces and review

Both tools support isolated Git worktrees, terminals, diff review, browser previews, GitHub workflows, schedules, and remote machines.

OpenChamber adds multi-run comparisons, Fusion, and guided changes walkthroughs. Paseo adds split panes and tabs, a native Files and Changes explorer, and a full pull-request workflow across its clients.

## Automation

Paseo exposes workspace and agent operations through its CLI, TypeScript SDK, and MCP server. These interfaces can create workspaces, launch agents, follow progress, send messages, and manage schedules.

OpenChamber's CLI runs and manages its server, remote access, and updates. Its Agent Control Tool lets an OpenCode agent create and continue sessions, create worktrees, and manage schedules.

## Mobile and voice

Both tools provide iOS and Android clients and support dictation and spoken replies. Paseo uses a React Native mobile interface. OpenChamber packages its web interface with Capacitor and adds native integrations around the WebView.
